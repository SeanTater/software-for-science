# Software for science: Software Engineering and CS for DS

# Who we are
We're Chang Lee and Sean Gallagher, and we're data scientists; we develop software for analyzing datasets at Lowe's.
In the course of our work we encounter many interesting and challenging problems, which is the fun part! So we decided to share some of it, and some of our strategies and solutions. We'll cover a range of topics, ranging from the fundamentals, especially time and memory complexity, with practical examples. But also we'll cover more unusual concepts like monads, lenses and transactional memory, for abstracting away side effects and even the whole `RealWorld`. We even dig into existing open source projects to see deep internals such as memory layout and its effects on efficiency and programming style.
